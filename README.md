# Calculator

This is my calculator project and was inspired by Dave & Buster's. I named it Zunaid after my friend who helped me with the idea by bringing Dave & Buster's up in a conversation. This calculator gives you the total amount of gaming coins that you will get depending on the amount of money you put it and with how many gaming cards you want to divide it with. For the benefit of our arcade guests we are aware that nobody can receive a portion of a coin so in the case that the amount of coins comes out with an extra portion, we will round up to give you the whole coin. That's what we do here at Zunaid & Buster's.

Here at Zunaid & Buster's everybody is a winner!
